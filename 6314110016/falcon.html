<h3>STORY</h3>

<p>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier[a] is an American television miniseries created by Malcolm Spellman for the
    streaming service Disney+, based on Marvel Comics featuring the characters Sam Wilson / Falcon and Bucky Barnes /
    Winter Soldier. It is the second television series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) produced by 
   Marvel Studios, sharing continuity with the films of the franchise and taking place after the events of
    the film Avengers: Endgame (2019). Spellman served as head writer with Kari Skogland directing.
   Sebastian Stan and Anthony Mackie reprise their respective roles as Bucky Barnes and Sam Wilson from the 
   film series, with Wyatt Russell, Erin Kellyman, Danny Ramirez, Georges St-Pierre, Adepero Oduye, Don Cheadle,
    Daniel Br√ºhl, Emily VanCamp, Florence Kasumba, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus also starring. By September 2018,
    Marvel Studios was developing a number of limited series for Disney+, centered on supporting characters 
   from the MCU films such as Wilson and Barnes. Spellman was hired in October, and chose to focus on the
    racial issues raised by Wilson being handed Captain America's shield at the end of Endgame. The Falcon
    and the Winter Soldier was confirmed in April 2019, and Skogland was hired the next month. Filming began
    in October 2019 in Atlanta, Georgia, before moving to the Czech Republic in March 2020. Production was 
   halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but resumed in Atlanta in September before wrapping in the Czech
    Republic in October.
