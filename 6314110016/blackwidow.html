<h3>STORY</h3>

<p>In 1995, super soldier Alexei Shostakov and Black Widow Melina Vostokoff work as Russian undercover agents,
    posing as a family in Ohio with Natasha Romanoff and Yelena Belova as their daughters. They steal S.H.I.E.L.D.
    intel and escape to Cuba where their boss, General Dreykov, has Romanoff and Belova taken to the Red Room for 
   training. Years pass, during which Shostakov is imprisoned in Russia while Romanoff defects to S.H.I.E.L.D. 
   after bombing Dreykov's Budapest office and apparently killing him and his young daughter Antonia.
   In 2016, Romanoff is a fugitive for violating the Sokovia Accords.[b] She escapes from U.S. Secretary of State 
   Thaddeus Ross and flees to a safehouse in Norway supplied by Rick Mason. Meanwhile, Belova kills a rogue former
    Black Widow but comes in contact with a synthetic gas that neutralizes the Red Room's chemical mind-control
    agent. Belova sends antidote vials to Romanoff, hoping she and the Avengers can free the other Widows, and
    goes into hiding. When Romanoff is unknowingly driving with the vials in her car, Red Room agent Taskmaster
    attacks her. Romanoff escapes from Taskmaster and realizes that the vials came from Budapest. There she finds
    Belova who reveals that Dreykov is alive and the Red Room is still active. Black Widows and Taskmaster attack
    them, but Romanoff and Belova evade them and meet with Mason, who supplies them with a helicopter.
