<h3>STORY</h3>

<p>In Russia, the media covers Tony Stark's disclosure of his identity as Iron Man. Ivan Vanko, whose father,
    Anton Vanko, a former Stark Industries employee, has just died, sees this and begins building a miniature 
   arc reactor similar to Stark's. Six months later,[N 2] Stark is a superstar and uses his Iron Man suit for 
   peaceful means, resisting government pressure to sell his designs. To continue the legacy of his father Howard,
    he reinstitutes the Stark Expo in New York City's Flushing Meadowsâ€“Corona Park.
   Later, Stark learns that the palladium core in the arc reactor that keeps him alive and powers the armor is slowly 
   poisoning him, and he cannot find a substitute. Growing increasingly reckless and despondent about his impending
    death, and choosing not to tell anyone about his condition, Stark appoints his personal assistant Pepper Potts 
   as CEO of Stark Industries and hires Stark employee Natalie Rushman to replace her as his personal assistant.
    Stark competes in the Monaco Historic Grand Prix, where he is attacked in the middle of the race by Vanko, 
   who is wielding electrified whips. Stark dons his armor and defeats Vanko, but the suit is severely damaged. 
   Vanko explains that his intention was to prove to the world that Iron Man is not invincible. Impressed by 
   Vanko's performance, Stark's rival, Justin Hammer, fakes Vanko's death while breaking him out of prison and 
   asks him to build a line of armored suits to upstage Stark. During what he believes is his final birthday party,
    Stark gets drunk while wearing the Iron Man suit. Disgusted, Stark's best friend, U.S. Air Force Lieutenant
    Colonel James Rhodes, dons Stark's prototype armor and tries to restrain him. The fight ends in a stalemate, 
   and Rhodes confiscates the armor for the U.S. Air Force.</p>
