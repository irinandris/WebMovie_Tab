<h3>STORY</h3>

<p>Raquel starts narrating the story of her life. In a classroom, we see her refusing to read her assignment 
    as even though she knows how to write a story, she isn't brave enough to tell it. She then says that her 
    story doesn't start in this classroom, it actually starts in her house.
    Her house, as she describes, is a humble abode that, through ups and downs, ended up surrounded by an empire
     called the Hidalgo mansion. The Hidalgos are her next-door neighbors, but their lifestyle is completely 
    different from hers. The Hidalgos own Alpha 3, one of the most influential companies in the country, whose
     headquarters is the most spectacular building in Barcelona.</p>
