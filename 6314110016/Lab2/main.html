 <h1>Welcome to Our Web Site!</h1>

 <p>We have designed this site to teach about the wonders
 of <strong><em>XHTML</em></strong>. <em>XHTML</em> is
 better equipped than <em>HTML</em> to represent complex
 data on the Internet. <em>XHTML</em> takes advantage of
 XMLâ€™s strict syntax to ensure well-formedness. Soon you
 will know about many of the great new features of
 <em>XHTML.</em></p>

 <p>Have Fun With the Site!</p>
