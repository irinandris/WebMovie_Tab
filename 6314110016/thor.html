<h3>STORY</h3>

<p>In 965 AD, Odin, king of Asgard, wages war against the Frost Giants of Jotunheim and their leader Laufey,
    to prevent them from conquering the Nine Realms, starting with Earth. The Asgardian warriors defeat the
    Frost Giants in Tønsberg, Norway, and seize the source of their power, the Casket of Ancient Winters.
   In the present,[N 2] Odin's son Thor prepares to ascend to the throne of Asgard, but is interrupted when 
   Frost Giants, secretly allowed in by his brother Loki, attempt to retrieve the Casket. Against Odin's order,
    Thor travels to Jotunheim to confront Laufey, accompanied by Loki, childhood friend Sif and the Warriors Three: 
   Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun. A battle ensues until Odin intervenes to save the Asgardians, destroying the
    fragile truce between the two races. For Thor's arrogance, Odin strips his son of his godly power and exiles 
   him to Earth as a mortal, accompanied by his hammer Mjölnir, now protected by an enchantment that allows only
    the worthy to wield it.
