<h3>STORY</h3>

<p>An Avenger who can harness chaos magic, engage in telepathy and telekinesis, and alter reality.
    Olsen said the series brings the character more in line with the comic book version, including depicting her 
    mental illness, while introducing the "Scarlet Witch" moniker to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).
     Executive producer Kevin Feige said the series explores the extent and origin of Maximoff's powers.
     Olsen felt her "ownership" of Maximoff was strengthened during development of the series,[9] which allowed 
    her to explore new parts of the character's personality such as her humor and sassiness. She was 
    thrilled that WandaVision focuses on Maximoff rather than making her a supporting character as in the films,
     and was sold on joining the series when Feige mentioned specific Scarlet Witch comic storylines that inspired 
    WandaVision.Olsen was influenced by Mary Tyler Moore, Elizabeth Montgomery, and Lucille Ball for her
     performance. Michaela Russell portrays a young Maximoff.
