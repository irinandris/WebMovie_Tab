<h3>STORY</h3>

<p>Two years after the Battle of New York,[N 1] Steve Rogers works in Washington, D.C., for the espionage agency
    S.H.I.E.L.D., while adjusting to contemporary society. During a mission alongside Agent Natasha Romanoff and 
   S.H.I.E.L.D.'s counter-terrorism S.T.R.I.K.E. team, led by Agent Brock Rumlow, to free hostages aboard a
    S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel from pirates led by Georges Batroc, Rogers discovers Romanoff has another agenda: to 
   extract data from the ship's computers. Returning to the Triskelion, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters, Rogers 
   confronts Director Nick Fury and is briefed about Project Insight: three Helicarriers linked to spy satellites, 
   designed to preemptively eliminate threats. Unable to decrypt Romanoff's data, Fury becomes suspicious about
    Insight and asks senior S.H.I.E.L.D. official and Secretary of Internal Security Alexander Pierce to delay 
   the project.
   On his way to rendezvous with Maria Hill, Fury is ambushed by assailants led by an assassin called the Winter 
   Soldier. Escaping to Rogers' apartment, Fury warns him that S.H.I.E.L.D. is compromised, but is wounded by 
   the Winter Soldier, before handing Rogers a flash drive containing the ship's data. Fury is pronounced dead 
   during surgery, and Hill recovers the body. The next day, Pierce summons Rogers to the Triskelion. When Rogers
    withholds Fury's information, Pierce brands him a fugitive. Hunted by S.T.R.I.K.E., Rogers meets with Romanoff.
    Using the data, they discover a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. bunker in New Jersey, where they activate a supercomputer
    containing the preserved consciousness of Arnim Zola. Zola informs them that after being captured by Rogers 
   during World War II,[N 2] he was recruited to S.H.I.E.L.D., where he secretly reformed Hydra within its ranks, 
   sowing global chaos with the objective of making humanity surrender its freedom in exchange for security, 
   using the Winter Soldier as their primary assassin. The pair narrowly escape death when a S.H.I.E.L.D. missile
    destroys the bunker, and realize that Pierce is Hydra's leader within S.H.I.E.L.D.
