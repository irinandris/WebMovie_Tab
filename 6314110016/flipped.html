<h3>STORY</h3>

<p>Four years later, Juli is still completely enamored, rarely leaving Bryce alone. He tries everything to get
    rid of her, including dating Sherry Stalls, one of the most popular girls in school, whom he knows she dislikes.
    This does not deter her. Bryce's best friend Garrett, who has a crush on Sherry, tells her why Bryce is dating her,
    so she dumps him. Embarrassed, Bryce looks forward to seventh grade as he hopes with more students Juli will
    finally meet someone else.
   The following year, Chet Duncan, Bryce's grandfather, moves in with the family. Juli adores an old sycamore tree
    in their neighborhood, but one day discovers the tree is going to be cut down. Juli tries to prevent its removal
    by climbing it and refusing to come down. After much attention from the town, her father Richard convinces her
    to come out of the tree and it is cut down. Juli is almost inconsolable until Richard gives her a painting of the
    tree, which helps her overcome her distress, and her exploits are written about in the local paper.
